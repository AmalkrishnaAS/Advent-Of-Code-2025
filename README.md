## 📂 Structure

Each day's solution is in its own directory (`01/`, `02/`, etc.) containing:
- `solution.cpp` - The C++ solution source code.
- `input.txt` - The puzzle input file.
- `sample.txt` - Sample input from the problem description.
- `a.out` - Compiled binary (included in the repository).

## 🚀 Building and Running

To build and run a solution, navigate to the day's directory and run the following commands:

```bash
# Compile the solution
g++ solution.cpp -o solution

# Run the solution
# Note: The solution reads directly from 'input.txt' in the current directory.
./solution
```
